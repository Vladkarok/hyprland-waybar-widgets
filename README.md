# Omarchy Fixes

Small fixes I keep around for an Omarchy setup.

This repo currently has six buckets:

- `waybar/`: custom Waybar widgets and config snippets
- `omarchy/`: power profile, brightness, and screenshot fixes for Omarchy
- `hypr/`: Hyprland config files with no upstream Omarchy equivalent
- `shell/`: zsh config and Powerlevel10k prompt
- `remmina/`: RDP client config — guest hotkeys and sharpness on a fractional-scale panel
- `docs/`: notes about this setup

See [docs/customizations.md](docs/customizations.md) for a full inventory of what is
customized against stock Omarchy and why — written to support wiping back to defaults
on the Omarchy 4.0 upgrade and re-adding tweaks deliberately.

### Keyboard Layout Widget

This works around the known IPC parsing problems in Waybar's built-in `hyprland/language` module by treating the socket event as a trigger and reading the real layout state from `hyprctl devices -j`.

Dependencies:

- `hyprctl`
- `jq`
- `socat`

Install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/waybar/scripts
install -m755 waybar/keyboard-layout.sh ~/.config/waybar/scripts/keyboard-layout.sh
```

Find your keyboard device name:

```bash
hyprctl devices -j | jq -r '.keyboards[] | .name'
```

Waybar snippet:

```jsonc
"modules-right": [
  "custom/language"
],

"custom/language": {
  "exec": "~/.config/waybar/scripts/keyboard-layout.sh <YOUR_KEYBOARD_NAME>",
  "return-type": "json",
  "on-click": "hyprctl switchxkblayout all next"
}
```

Optional CSS:

```css
#custom-language.en {
  color: #89b4fa;
}

#custom-language.ua {
  color: #f9e2af;
}
```

### Calendar Toggle

This adds a Waybar calendar icon that opens a small GTK calendar popup. It is
self-contained and does not need `gsimplecal`, `yad`, or another external
calendar app.

Files:

- `waybar/calendar-toggle.py`
- `waybar/examples/calendar-toggle.jsonc`
- `waybar/examples/calendar-toggle.css`

Dependencies:

- `python3`
- `python-gobject`
- GTK 3
- `pgrep`
- `pkill`

Install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/waybar/scripts
install -m755 waybar/calendar-toggle.py ~/.config/waybar/scripts/calendar-toggle.py
```

Add `custom/calendar` to `modules-center`, for example next to the clock:

```jsonc
"modules-center": [
  "clock",
  "custom/calendar",
  "custom/weather"
]
```

Waybar snippet:

```jsonc
"custom/calendar": {
  "exec": "python3 ~/.config/waybar/scripts/calendar-toggle.py status",
  "return-type": "json",
  "format": "{}",
  "tooltip": true,
  "on-click": "python3 ~/.config/waybar/scripts/calendar-toggle.py toggle",
  "signal": 12,
  "interval": 60
}
```

Optional CSS:

```css
#custom-calendar {
  min-width: 12px;
  margin-left: 7.5px;
  margin-right: 7.5px;
}

#custom-calendar.active {
  color: #a55555;
}
```

### Screen Keyboard Toggle

This adds a manual Waybar icon for toggling `wvkbd`. The widget reports active
while the keyboard process is running, so it uses start/stop instead of
signal-based hide/show.

Files:

- `waybar/screen-keyboard.sh`
- `waybar/examples/screen-keyboard.jsonc`
- `waybar/examples/screen-keyboard.css`

Dependencies:

- `wvkbd`
- `pgrep`
- `pkill`

Install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/waybar/scripts
install -m755 waybar/screen-keyboard.sh ~/.config/waybar/scripts/screen-keyboard.sh
```

Add `custom/screen-keyboard` to `modules-right`, for example next to the
language indicator:

```jsonc
"modules-right": [
  "custom/language",
  "custom/screen-keyboard"
]
```

Waybar snippet:

```jsonc
"custom/screen-keyboard": {
  "exec": "~/.config/waybar/scripts/screen-keyboard.sh status",
  "return-type": "json",
  "format": "{}",
  "tooltip": true,
  "on-click": "~/.config/waybar/scripts/screen-keyboard.sh toggle",
  "signal": 11,
  "interval": 10
}
```

Optional CSS:

```css
#custom-screen-keyboard {
  min-width: 12px;
  margin-right: 12px;
}

#custom-screen-keyboard.active {
  color: #a55555;
}
```

Optional Hyprland binding:

```ini
bindd = SUPER ALT, K, Toggle screen keyboard, exec, ~/.config/waybar/scripts/screen-keyboard.sh toggle
```

### CPU Hover Widget

This replaces the stock `cpu` module with a custom widget that shows total CPU usage % to the left of the icon and exposes much more detail on hover.

Tooltip data:

- total CPU load
- per-core load
- per-core temperature when exposed by the kernel
- session peak temperature
- 10-sample CPU load sparklines for total and per-core history

Install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/waybar/scripts
install -m755 waybar/cpu-status.py ~/.config/waybar/scripts/cpu-status.py
```

Waybar snippet:

```jsonc
"modules-right": [
  "custom/cpu"
],

"custom/cpu": {
  "exec": "python3 ~/.config/waybar/scripts/cpu-status.py",
  "return-type": "json",
  "interval": 1,
  "tooltip": true
}
```

Optional CSS:

```css
#custom-cpu.warm {
  color: #d79921;
}

#custom-cpu.hot {
  color: #fe8019;
}

#custom-cpu.critical {
  color: #fb4934;
}
```

Notes:

- On many Intel CPUs, temperatures are exposed per physical core, not per logical thread.
- The `peak` value is tracked by the script for the current boot session.
- The sparkline is CPU load history, not temperature history.

### Built-in Memory Widget

If you do not need a custom RAM graph yet, the built-in `memory` module is enough — the example shows usage % next to the icon with a useful hover tooltip.

Files:

- `waybar/examples/memory-builtin.jsonc`
- `waybar/examples/memory-builtin.css`

Recommended behavior:

- show usage percentage to the left of the icon in the bar
- show percentage and used / total GiB on hover
- keep warning and critical colors through `states`

### Volume Level Indicator

Omarchy's stock `pulseaudio` module can show only one icon per output type and cannot distinguish exact `0%` from other values in the first icon bucket. The custom example keeps the widget icon-only but uses a tiny left-side level glyph for low / medium / high volume, with a distinct `×` marker for muted or exact `0%`.

Files:

- `waybar/examples/pulseaudio-volume-level.jsonc`
- `waybar/examples/pulseaudio-volume-level.css`
- `waybar/volume-status.py`

Recommended behavior:

- show rough low / medium / high output volume without another percentage
- show exact `0%` and muted as a distinct `×` state
- keep speaker, headphone, and headset states visually distinct

Dependencies:

- `pactl`
- `pamixer`

Install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/waybar/scripts
install -m755 waybar/volume-status.py ~/.config/waybar/scripts/volume-status.py
```

Replace `pulseaudio` with `custom/volume` in `modules-right`:

```jsonc
"modules-right": [
  "custom/volume"
]
```

Waybar snippet:

```jsonc
"custom/volume": {
  "exec": "python3 ~/.config/waybar/scripts/volume-status.py",
  "return-type": "json",
  "interval": 1,
  "on-click": "omarchy-launch-audio",
  "on-click-right": "pamixer -t",
  "on-scroll-up": "pamixer -i 5",
  "on-scroll-down": "pamixer -d 5",
  "tooltip": true
}
```

Optional CSS:

```css
#custom-volume {
  min-width: 28px;
}
```

Reload Waybar:

```bash
pkill -SIGUSR2 waybar
```

### Linear Brightness Controls

Omarchy's stock brightness controls operate directly on hardware backlight
percentages. On some panels, including `nvidia_wmi_ec_backlight`, that feels
non-linear: the top end changes slowly and the low end changes abruptly.

This repo keeps one shared gamma-corrected helper for display brightness:

- `omarchy/bin/omarchy-brightness-display`
- `waybar/brightness-status.py`
- `waybar/brightness-slider.py`
- `waybar/brightness-toggle.py`
- `waybar/examples/backlight-linear.jsonc`

The helper exposes adjusted user-facing percentages and maps them to raw
hardware backlight values with `OMARCHY_BRIGHTNESS_GAMMA` (default `2.2`). It
clamps normal brightness to `OMARCHY_BRIGHTNESS_MIN` (default `5`) as a real
hardware backlight floor, so normal brightness keys do not set the panel below
5%; display-off still uses the separate `off` action.

Install:

```bash
install -Dm755 omarchy/bin/omarchy-brightness-display ~/.local/bin/omarchy-brightness-display
install -Dm755 waybar/brightness-status.py ~/.config/waybar/scripts/brightness-status.py
install -Dm755 waybar/brightness-toggle.py ~/.config/waybar/scripts/brightness-toggle.py
install -Dm755 waybar/brightness-slider.py ~/.config/waybar/scripts/brightness-slider.py
```

Waybar snippet:

```jsonc
"custom/brightness": {
  "exec": "python3 ~/.config/waybar/scripts/brightness-status.py nvidia_wmi_ec_backlight",
  "return-type": "json",
  "on-click": "python3 ~/.config/waybar/scripts/brightness-toggle.py nvidia_wmi_ec_backlight",
  "on-scroll-up": "omarchy-brightness-display +5% nvidia_wmi_ec_backlight",
  "on-scroll-down": "omarchy-brightness-display 5%- nvidia_wmi_ec_backlight",
  "tooltip": true,
  "interval": 2
}
```

Fn brightness keys already call `omarchy-brightness-display` from Omarchy's
stock Hyprland media bindings. With `~/.local/bin` before Omarchy's bin
directory in `~/.config/uwsm/env`, this override applies to Fn keys, Waybar
scroll, and the slider. Change `OMARCHY_BRIGHTNESS_GAMMA` in one place to tune
the curve everywhere.

## Omarchy

Included files:

- `omarchy/bin/omarchy-powerprofiles-apply`
- `omarchy/bin/omarchy-powerprofiles-set`
- `omarchy/bin/omarchy-brightness-display`
- `omarchy/patches/omarchy-menu-power-profile.patch`
- `tensaku/config.toml`: closes the screenshot editor after copy/save/save-as

### Power Profile Fixes

These fix two separate issues in Omarchy's power profile flow:

1. `powerprofilesctl` can report a profile change while CPU governors remain stuck on `performance`, so the actual behavior does not change.
2. Walker can keep the visual focus on the first row, so the power menu can appear to highlight the wrong current profile.

### What The Fixes Do

- `omarchy-powerprofiles-apply` applies the requested profile and repairs the stuck-governor case before retrying.
- `omarchy-powerprofiles-set` routes AC and battery transitions through that helper.
- `omarchy-menu-power-profile.patch` makes the power menu put the current profile first and call the helper instead of raw `powerprofilesctl set`.

### Install

Copy the helper scripts into your Omarchy checkout:

```bash
install -Dm755 omarchy/bin/omarchy-powerprofiles-apply ~/.local/share/omarchy/bin/omarchy-powerprofiles-apply
install -Dm755 omarchy/bin/omarchy-powerprofiles-set ~/.local/share/omarchy/bin/omarchy-powerprofiles-set
```

Apply the menu patch from the Omarchy repo root:

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/omarchy
git apply /path/to/this/repo/omarchy/patches/omarchy-menu-power-profile.patch
```

Notes:

- The governor recovery path uses `sudo -n` when it is not already running as root.
- The helper only resets governors when a non-`performance` profile should be active and the kernel is still pinned to `performance`.

### Screenshot Annotation: Satty → Tensaku

**Nothing to install — Omarchy 4 replaced Satty entirely.**

Omarchy 4 drops Satty and ships [Tensaku](https://github.com/jondkinney/tensaku)
as the screenshot annotator (`tensaku` 0.28.0, GTK4 + libadwaita, MPL-2.0).
`omarchy-capture-screenshot` reads the editor from `$OMARCHY_SCREENSHOT_EDITOR`
and falls back to `tensaku-edit`, so it works with no configuration. The upgrade
uninstalls the `satty` package.

Tensaku is a Satty fork and keeps the same CLI surface — `--actions-on-enter`,
`--early-exit`, `--copy-command`, `--corner-roundness`,
`--annotation-size-factor`, `--default-hide-toolbars`. Its `--help` text still
carries Satty's own version notes verbatim ("0.20.1: This does not apply to save
as"), and the packaged wrapper `/usr/bin/tensaku-edit` says outright that it
matches "what Omarchy's built-in satty editor branch passes".

**The Save-As work survived the switch.** The filename prefill and remembered
directory from [gabm/satty#499](https://github.com/gabm/satty/pull/499) came
across with the fork: the wrapper passes `--output-filename`, which is all the
feature needs, and the remembered directory lands in
`~/.local/state/tensaku/save_as_last_dir`. No local patch, no config.

**Auto-close is back, and it is per action now.** The packaged wrapper passes
`--actions-on-enter save-to-clipboard --save-after-copy --copy-command wl-copy`
and does *not* pass `--early-exit`, so the auto-close that
`~/.config/satty/config.toml` used to provide has to be re-declared. Tensaku
reads `~/.config/tensaku/config.toml`:

```toml
[general]
close-on-copy = true
close-on-save = true
early-exit-save-as = true
```

Which key ends which action (`src/sketch_board.rs`):

| Action | Reached by | Closes on |
|---|---|---|
| `SaveToClipboard` | Enter, via the wrapper's `--actions-on-enter` | `close-on-copy` |
| `SaveToFile` | Ctrl+S | `close-on-save` |
| `SaveToFileAs` | Save As | `early-exit-save-as` |

Satty's old single `early-exit` still parses — it is a fallback that fills in
`close-on-copy` and `close-on-save` when neither is set explicitly — but it
never covered Save As, which is why the third key exists. Note that Enter runs
through *copy*, not save, even though `--save-after-copy` writes the file: with
only `close-on-save` set, the default Omarchy flow leaves the window open.

Config keys are validated on startup (`deny_unknown_fields`), so a typo is a
loud parse error rather than a silently ignored line. `tensaku --doctor` is
enough to check it.

Beyond Satty, Tensaku adds `--scroll-capture` (scrolling screenshots, with
auto-scroll over the xdg-desktop-portal RemoteDesktop/libei handshake),
`--resize smart`, `--fullscreen current|all`, and `--floating-hack`.

Migration cleanup, once Satty is gone:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/satty ~/.local/state/satty
```

Notes:

- Historical: a shell wrapper (`omarchy-cmd-screenshot`, `gsettings` filechooser
  hack) → a patched Satty build → upstream Satty 0.21.x → Omarchy 4 on Tensaku.
  Every local workaround on this path is now retired.
- Earlier stale PRs on this topic: #2421, #3226.
- Omarchy discussions #5438 (RESOLVED) and #5439 (OUTDATED) were closed against
  Satty and need no revisiting.

## Hyprland

Personal overrides that have **no upstream Omarchy equivalent**. Omarchy's
`omarchy refresh hyprland` can restore any of its own defaults, but it knows
nothing about these, so this is their only backup.

Omarchy 4 moved the whole config from `.conf` to Lua, and a `.lua` entry point
cannot `source` a `.conf` file, so the old files here were translated rather
than copied. `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua` loads Omarchy's defaults first and
the personal files after, which is what makes them win:

```lua
require("default.hypr.omarchy")
require("hypr.envs")
require("hypr.bindings")
require("hypr.looknfeel")
require("hypr.windows")
```

### `hypr/windows.lua`

Per-app window rules, written with Omarchy's `o.window(match, rules)` helper.

Chat apps (Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp/Whatsie, Viber) land on workspace 1 as a
single tabbed group. `group = "set"` opens each as a group and Hyprland's
`group.auto_group` merges the next one in, so the rules deliberately do *not*
use `silent` — auto-group only merges into the **focused** group, and
`autostart.lua` staggers the launches so they map in order.

Two rules are load-bearing in a way that is easy to undo by accident:

- `float = false` on chat apps and on Last War. These map transient splash or
  login windows under the same class; one floating member drags the entire
  group floating.
- `group = "override barred"` on Telegram's media viewer and Discord's updater.
  Both share the class of their main window, so without it they join the group
  and hijack it — fullscreen a picture, close it, and the survivor stays stuck
  fullscreen.

The opacity line restates Omarchy's own `default-opacity` tag rule (`"1 0.96"`)
so the focused window is fully opaque; Omarchy applies opacity through that tag,
not through `decoration:active_opacity`, so overriding it requires restating the
tag rule after the defaults load.

App classes were found by trial and error and are not guessable — Whatsie
reports `com.ktechpit.whatsie`, Last War runs as `steam_proton` and is separated
from its launcher only by window title.

### `hypr/looknfeel.lua`

Zero gaps, `misc:focus_on_activate = false` (an activation request from another
workspace should not yank the view over — this was in the old `looknfeel.conf`
and the Lua migration dropped it), and a tightened groupbar: no indicator gap,
3px between tabs, and opaque tab chips so the wallpaper shows only in the seams
and the tab borders stay readable.

### `hypr/bindings.lua`

Personal rebinds only, each through a local `rebind()` that unbinds first so a
future Omarchy update cannot claim the key back: Last War, ChatGPT and Claude
desktop apps over Omarchy's web-app bindings, `emote` as the emoji picker, a
lid-close handler that turns the panel off without locking, a passthrough submap
for RDP/VM guests, and `SUPER + CTRL + SHIFT + arrows` to reorder tabs inside a
group (Omarchy binds only focus movement, `SUPER + CTRL + arrows`).

### `hypr/envs.lua`

`SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland`, a custom `OMARCHY_SCREENSHOT_DIR`, and
`LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=iHD` — on this hybrid-GPU laptop Omarchy's `nvidia.lua`
forces the `nvidia` VA-API driver, which breaks video decode in every
Chromium-based app.

### Install

```bash
cp hypr/*.lua ~/.config/hypr/
hyprctl reload && hyprctl configerrors
```

`hyprland.lua` is included, so this also restores the `require` order above.
See [docs/customizations.md](docs/customizations.md) for the full inventory
(still written against the pre-Omarchy-4 `.conf` layout).

## Shell

Zsh setup with a Powerlevel10k prompt. Stored without the leading dot so the
files stay visible; the mapping is:

| repo | installed as |
| --- | --- |
| `shell/zshrc` | `~/.zshrc` |
| `shell/zsh_aliases` | `~/.zsh_aliases` |
| `shell/p10k.zsh` | `~/.p10k.zsh` |

### Prompt

Powerlevel10k in Pure style (`p10k-pure.zsh`, snazzy colors, 2-line, transient
prompt, instant prompt). `.zshrc` keeps three ordering rules that matter:

- the instant-prompt block must stay at the **top** of the file
- `zsh-syntax-highlighting` must be sourced **last** among plugins
- the prompt theme is sourced **last** overall, and keybindings come after the
  plugins so they are not overridden

### Not self-contained

These files only configure things — they do not install them. A fresh machine
needs the plugins and theme checked out under `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/` first:

- `plugins/zsh-autosuggestions`
- `plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting`
- `themes/powerlevel10k`

`.zshrc` also assumes these are on PATH and will error noisily without them:
`zoxide`, `fzf`, `fnm`, plus `eza`, `bat`, `broot`, `nvim` for the aliases.
Some blocks are installer-managed (grok, agterm agent-status, the Oracle CLI
completion, and the `~/.local/bin/env` line from the uv installer) and will be
rewritten by those tools rather than by hand.

### Install

```bash
cp shell/zshrc ~/.zshrc
cp shell/zsh_aliases ~/.zsh_aliases
cp shell/p10k.zsh ~/.p10k.zsh
exec zsh
```

Run `p10k configure` to regenerate the prompt from scratch instead.

Note: `~/.config/starship.toml` also exists on this system but nothing sources
it — a leftover from before the switch to Powerlevel10k. It is not tracked here.
