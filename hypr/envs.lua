-- default/hypr/nvidia.lua sets LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=nvidia on any NVIDIA machine
-- with GSP. That is wrong on this hybrid laptop: Chromium composites on the
-- Intel render node (renderD129) but is then told to decode on NVIDIA
-- (renderD128), and the cross-GPU dma-buf import fails with EGL_BAD_MATCH.
-- Result is black/green frames on H.264 sites and a hard freeze in Google Meet.
--
-- The NVIDIA VA-API shim is also decode-only: no VAEntrypointVideoProc and no
-- encode entrypoints at all. Intel's iHD has EncSlice, EncSliceLP and VideoProc.
-- Firefox is unaffected because nvidia-vaapi-driver is written against Firefox
-- and falls back to software decode cleanly.
